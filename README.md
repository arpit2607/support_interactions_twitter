# Effectiveness of Customer Support Interactions on Twitter

# Research Question:
The central question of our research is, "How effective are customer support interactions on Twitter, and what patterns of communication contribute to successful resolutions?" This inquiry is novel in its comprehensive exploration of various dimensions of digital customer support on a major social media platform. Unlike traditional studies that primarily focus on generic customer support metrics, this project delves deep into the multifaceted nature of interactions on Twitter, a platform where public visibility adds a unique dimension to customer service.
